# HTML Imports

This is a demo for creating a component-based site. More for playing around with than anything serious.

I think it might be interesting for the process of writing re-usable components without PHP, Node etc... though it's Chrome-only for now. I was thinking of the process from taking a design to doing the initial front-end work, and getting the parts together quickly without too much setup.
